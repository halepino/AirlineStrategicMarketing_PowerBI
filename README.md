## Airline Strategic Analysis & Marketing
*A scenario-based project with real data*

### Objective
Sunset Air is suffering a media scare campaign. Claims of a rise in flight accidents in the media are threatening the industry. This project takes currently available data from a range of sources to perform an investigation of media claims. The findings are then presented in various audience level reports and visualizations to combat the issue. Primary tools for this project include Power BI and Power Point. This project includes the following:  
* Internal Dashboards for the technical team
* Internal Dashboard for the executive team
* Inforgraphic design for customers
* Mock Interview [Blog Post](https://hpfdatalore.wixsite.com/travelnewz/post/read-this-blog-if-you-want-to-live)

### Repo Contents
The folders of this repo contain PDF formats to quickly view dashboards and inforgraphics. The Power BI files are also available in a separate folder. Another folder is dedicated to visual/audio presentations related to this project.
